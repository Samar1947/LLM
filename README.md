# Fine-Tuning BART for Natural Language to SQL Query Generation

## Project Overview
This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BART model (`facebook/bart-base`) to translate natural language questions into structured SQL queries. The fine-tuning was performed on a curated subset of the Gretel synthetic text-to-SQL dataset.

The project covers:
- Dataset preparation and cleaning
- Model fine-tuning with hyperparameter optimization
- Model evaluation against baseline
- Error analysis and suggested improvements
- Inference pipeline via Gradio app

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install the required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**
Download the subset of the Gretel dataset or generate it using the provided script inside the `dataset/` folder.

5. **Train the Model**
```bash
python train.py
```

6. **Launch the Gradio Inference App**
```bash
python inference.py
```
